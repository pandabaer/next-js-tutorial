- Pages Router of Next.js might be obsolete
    - App Routing is the new way to go
- Next.js "Middleware" seems to be the way to do HTTP requests, which complies to Web API standards


https://nextjs.org/docs#main-features

Some of the main Next.js features include:

Routing         A file-system based router built on top of Server Components that supports layouts, nested routing, loading states, error handling, and more.
Rendering       Client-side and Server-side Rendering with Client and Server Components. Further optimized with Static and Dynamic Rendering on the server with Next.js. Streaming on Edge and Node.js runtimes.
Data Fetching   Simplified data fetching with async/await in Server Components, and an extended fetch API for request memoization, data caching and revalidation.
